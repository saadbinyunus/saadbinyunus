I build distributed, concurrent, and cloud-native systems with a focus on performance, correctness, and scalability. My work sits at the intersection of backend engineering, real-time communication, and systems-level design.

I’m particularly interested in infrastructure engineering, storage systems, and large-scale backend platforms.

Technical Focus

Distributed Systems & Microservices

Concurrency & Asynchronous Architectures

Real-Time Communication (gRPC, WebSocket)

Cloud Infrastructure (Azure, AWS, Docker)

Backend Engineering (Python, Java, Go – in progress)

Systems Programming & Hardware Verification

Selected Projects
Air Traffic Control System

Python | gRPC | WebSocket | Docker | Azure

A distributed, real-time air traffic control simulator deployed on Microsoft Azure.

Designed gRPC-based inter-service communication with WebSocket streaming (<100ms updates)

Built concurrency-safe runway scheduling engine supporting 100+ concurrent flight operations

Implemented event-driven asynchronous architecture

Containerized microservices for scalable deployment

UVM-Based AXI4-Lite Verification Environment

SystemVerilog | UVM | Verilator

Developed modular UVM testbench (driver, monitor, scoreboard architecture)

Implemented constrained-random verification with protocol assertions

Verified VALID/READY handshake edge cases

Achieved comprehensive functional coverage for read/write transactions

Hybrid Machine Learning – Diabetes Prediction

Python | Scikit-learn | XGBoost

Built ensemble pipeline achieving 90%+ accuracy

Implemented feature engineering, IQR/LOF outlier detection, and SMOTE balancing

Tuned models using GridSearchCV

Engineering Stack

Languages: Python, Java, C, SQL, VHDL, Verilog
Backend: gRPC, REST APIs, FastAPI, Flask
Cloud & DevOps: Docker, Azure, AWS
Data & ML: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost
Systems: Linux, Networking (TCP/IP), SCADA/EMS

Currently Exploring

Distributed storage systems

Consistency models & fault tolerance

Advanced system design patterns

Kubernetes and infrastructure automation

Background

Computer Engineering graduate with 16 months of experience at IESO contributing to SCADA systems, QA automation, and infrastructure tooling.
